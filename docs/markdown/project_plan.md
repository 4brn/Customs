## Introduction

The aim of the project is to create an engaging 2d game,
training both critical thinking and fast reactions, 
while shining light on controversial real life problems such as
job market stability, stress and transportation safety.

## Objective

The main objective is to create a simple, user-friendly and entertaining
2d game in the span of 4 weeks.

The game will:

- Train reaction time: the player needs to react to fast moving objects
- Train critical thinking: the player need to create strategies to deal with increasing number of objects
- Engage: immersive story and gameplay will engage the player
- Challenge: progressive difficulty will give the player a challenge

## Main Question
