## Introduction

The purpose of this project was to create a simple game using a simple game engine, written in a simple programming language.

My goal was to build a foundation in game development, Lua programming and markdown documentation, while improving my time management and professional skills.

## Learning

> During development and documentation of my progress on this project I learned the importance of time management. During the first two weeks I neglected development, which in the end reflected on the quality of the end product.

> I learned how to read documentation and specifications of game engines, programming languages, frameworks. The personal restriction to use AI made me turn to the documentation written by the creators of the PICO-8 engine.

> I understood basic game development concepts, game loops, rendering, pixel art, music composition and many more game development concepts.

> I gained a good understanding of the Lua programming language

## Project Highlights

- The game is completely cross platform, ensuring playability on any device.
- I hosted my game on the internet, allowing everyone to play it in the browser.
- My choice for a game engine allowed me to compile binaries for every major OS and the small size and low system specifications make my game suitable for every device.
- The game idea itself is original, being the result of a continuously evolving, chaotic and interesting development cycle.

## Peer Review

My game was played by my schoolmates in every aspect of development, ensuring I was in the right track and allowing me to implement feedback immediately during development.
Teachers expressed their interest in my game and in the end were satisfied with my product.

## Conclusion

Working on my game was a great experience that allowed me to learn new technologies, make a complete product with minimal knowledge of the underlying concepts of game development, game engines, game logic and music composition.
Excluding the obviously lacking areas of time management and perfectionism that I showed during these 4 weeks, I can confidently say that I learned a lot and will surely fix my mistakes in any upcoming projects.
