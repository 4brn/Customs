## Topics

### AI Basics {#ai}

AI is separated into these sub-topics:

- Data Preparation & Analysis
- Machine Learning
- Large Language Models
- AI Ethics

#### Data Preparation

Data preparation is the act of processing raw data to be used for further machine learning and analysis. Also called pre-processing, data preparation may not be an appealing task, but is crucial for the efficiency, clarity, and performance of machine learning projects and data analysis.

#### Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence. Machine Learning is used to train an AI model to recognize patterns and learn to program themselves through experience, like a human would. Models are trained by supplying them with a large dataset—the larger, the better—and by specifying the pattern it should be looking for.

There are 3 types of machine learning:

- **Supervised**: Models are trained with datasets labeled by humans beforehand. For example, someone labels all dog pictures in a dataset; by doing that, it enables the model to learn ways of identifying a dog when presented with a non-labeled picture.
- **Unsupervised**: Models are left to train themselves on unlabeled data.
- **Reinforcement**: Models learn by trial and error. The model is trained by telling the machine when it made a right decision, which over time reinforces the accuracy of the model.

#### Large Language Models

Large Language Models are neural network models used to mimic human intelligence, thought, and speech. Neural networks, inspired by the human brain, work by first being supplied with an enormously large dataset of books, text, and so on, to get a grasp of vocabulary and language. This allows the model to assign weights to each word and calculate the statistical probability of which word is likely to come next. Therefore, it has no actual knowledge of anything. It is a statistical map of language that can predict words. There is a chance that a model can hallucinate due to the fact it has no actual ability to understand and acquire genuine knowledge.

#### Tasks

- Training models
- Tweaking parameters

#### Professions

- Data Scientist
- Machine Learning Engineer

#### Companies

- OpenAI
- Google
- IBM

#### Verdict

At first, I was skeptical about AI, just because I don't like using them myself. After research, I was intrigued and resonated with data preparation and machine learning. I can consider studying AI basics if I don't like the other topics.

### Business IT & Data Analysis {#business}

Every IT project needs connection with the business world. Business IT helps communication between developers and clients.

Subtopics:

- Business Analysis
- Process Modelling
- Low Code Development
- Data Handling & Statistics

#### Business Analysis

Business Analysis gathers and analyzes company data in order to identify flaws and recommend solutions based on that data (data-driven). It also helps to convert the findings of data scientists and programmers into practical solutions that will help the company. It offers deep knowledge in business and competence in technology so that the information can be conveyed to the non-technical clients.

#### Process Modeling

Process Modeling is the visual representation of a process or a workflow. Most often, they are visualized using flowcharts and diagrams so that a person can get a visual and comprehensive insight into the inner workings of said process or workflow.

#### Low Code Development

Low code development is a method of developing software using minimal or no code. Development is done mostly by a graphical user interface and drag-and-drop tools.

#### Data Handling & Statistics

Data handling is the process of gathering and presenting data in an easy-to-understand and analyze way, using statistics. It is done mostly with graphs, pie charts, and diagrams, which help visualize and scale down large amounts of data in a simple way.

#### Companies

- Google
- Apple
- Nike

#### Verdict

Although the program has the most application in the real market and teaches you to convey information better, the fact that it revolves around displaying data in a graph and emphasizes using easier and no-code solutions for developing software are just some reasons why I most likely won't consider Business IT as my second semester choice.

### Game Development

Game Development is the art of creating games. Anything that allows a player to interact with the content and manipulate elements is considered a game. Art design, programming, audio, visual and graphic effects, and testing are all part of game development. This industry allows solo and big corporate game studios to coexist. The use of game engines such as Unity, Unreal Engine, and Godot is an industry standard but is not limited to that only. Your game can also be a text novel in the terminal... Apart from the programming, there are concepts such as player engagement, story, user experience, game performance...

#### Companies

- Sony
- Rockstar Games
- Behaviour

#### Verdict

The topic covers a large assortment of engines, programming, and game dev standards. It sounds like an exciting and possible choice for my second semester.

### Intelligent Technologies {#embedded}

- Embedded Software Development
- Microcontrollers
- Hardware-Software Interfacing

#### Embedded Software Development

Embedded systems are systems that carry out specialized tasks in a larger system. Embedded Software refers to the process of creating software and firmware that runs on embedded systems and helps them do their intended task. Embedded systems are most of the time small and have limited performance capabilities, so optimization and memory usage are really important. Embedded Software combines hardware and software in a way where you get to create physical products, have the ability and knowledge to optimize the software, and get to experience the software and hardware world, making you an all-round expert.

#### Companies

- Philips
- Tesla

#### Verdict

I like the idea of working on something physical while combining low-level programming knowledge, electronics, and hardware. Intelligent Technologies might be a good choice for the second semester.

### Interactive Media {#media}

- Experience Design
- Creative Thinking
- Basics of Media Creation
- Front-End Development

Interactive media is a really broad topic. Interactive media covers any media that requires users' input. This field includes graphic designers, programmers, media specialists... For example, you can create a media campaign for kids where they need to play a game on a website (that is a form of interactive media).

#### Companies

- McDonald's
- Coca-Cola
- Nike

#### Verdict

Although it sounds interesting, I don't want to work with media. I would like to specialize in something a bit more technical, therefore I won’t choose this one as my second semester module.

### Network & Cloud Basics {#networking}

- Connecting
- Provisioning & Managing IT Services
- DevOps

Networking and cloud are the backbone of the modern world. Every digital aspect of our lives revolves around networks. Networks are collections of interconnected devices (think of computers, servers, printers) that share resources and information. Daily tasks would include setting up servers and networks, monitoring network activity, fixing vulnerabilities...

#### DevOps

DevOps is the process of automating the software development cycle so that features can go to production quickly, reliably, and safely (setting up production environment, ...)

#### Professions

- Systems Administrator
- DevOps Engineer

#### Verdict

The idea of connecting systems together, surfing through each system, ensuring they are operating without even being in physical contact with them seems interesting. Also, being the backbone of computing and modern life makes it a fundamental topic to learn, unlocking further specialization in other fields. I will consider this as a possible choice for semester 2.

### Software Design & Engineering {#software}

Software Engineering is a branch of computer science and engineering focused on designing, developing, and maintaining software. Software Design refers to the brainstorming and designing of the software structure, technologies used, and logic flow. Software Engineering follows development principles making collaborative work structured and easy. Version control systems like Git make programming easy, enabling you to easily revert to a working version. Database interaction, user creation, data storage, and information security principles are included under Software Engineering as well.

#### Professions

- Software Developer
- Web Developer
- Mobile Development

#### Companies

- Startups
- Google
- AirBnB

#### Verdict

Software Engineering is the most popular and general topic, covering a broad aspect of the ICT field. I already have some experience with web development, but if I don't choose any other topic it's always an option.
